## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The smart crop advisory system is a digital decision support platform.That is used to empower
small and marginal farmers with location-specific.This system supports the users by giving crop specific
guidance.The solution ensures that farmers receive practical recommendations on sowing,irrigation,
fertilizer use,pest management,and harvest planning.

## Technical Approach
IoT-based soil sensors measure pH,moisture,nitrogen,phosphorus,potassium.unlike traditional extension services,this system
combines IoT+AI+remotesensing+mobile advisory into a personalized,low-cost,scalable solution that fits small and marginal farmers.
AI suggests crops not only based on soil/climate but also local market price trends.Helps farmers maximize profit instead of
only yield.The system collects field data,weather info,and soil parameters,analyzes it using AI/ML models,and provides real-time
crop management advice to farmers via mobile or web platforms
## Feasibility and Viability
A smart crop advisory system is feasible and viable for small and marginal farmers.However,its success depends on affordability,
local language support,awareness campaigns,reliable data accuracy.under feasibility,development cost can be reduced using
open-source platforms.for economic feasibility,government subsidies and NGO partnerships can make adoption affordable.
viability refers to long term sustainability and benefits.
## Impact and Benefits
Higher crop yield,Reduced costs,Minimized risks,Informed decisions,Sustainable farming,Improved livelihood
are the impacts of crop advisory system.It reduced costs by opti ized use of seeds,fertilizers,and Pesticides
lowers expenses.Encourages eco-friendly pratices and efficient resource use.It improves livelihood small farmers
earn better income and secure their future.Benefits of crop advisory system are increased productivity,Cost
efficiency,Risk reduction,Better decision making,Sustainable farming,Empowers farmers,Market support.
